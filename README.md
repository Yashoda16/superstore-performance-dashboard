# Superstore-performance-dashboard
This project visualizes sales and profit data from the Sample Superstore dataset, offering interactive dashboards to analyze performance across categories, regions, and segments for data-driven decisions.

# Interactive Dashboard: Sample Superstore Profit Summary

This Tableau project presents an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive profit summary for the Sample Superstore dataset. The dashboard allows for filtering and drilling down into various insights related to profit, broken down by categories, regions, subcategories, segments, and states. The dashboard is interactive and allows users to filter all visuals based on the Category dimension for in-depth analysis.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing profit-related insights for the Sample Superstore dataset in a clear, concise, and interactive manner. The dashboard summarizes profits across various dimensions, such as categories, regions, subcategories, and segments. The goal is to enable users to explore the profit performance across different business aspects, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

## Dashboard Features
**1. Month-Wise Profit Earned in Each Category**

- A line chart displays the monthly profit earned across each product category (e.g., Furniture, Technology, Office Supplies).
- Key metrics, such as the Minimum and Maximum profit for each category, are highlighted for easy reference.
- Users can visually track profit trends over time, helping to identify seasonal patterns or unusual fluctuations.

**2. Category-Wise Profit with Region Details**

- A bar chart shows the profit earned in each category, further broken down by regions (e.g., East, West, Central, South).
- This view helps users see which regions contribute the most or least profit within each category.

**3. Subcategory-Wise Profit (Waterfall Chart)**

- A waterfall chart is used to visualize the profit at the subcategory level, illustrating the cumulative contribution of each subcategory to the overall category profit.
- This allows for quick identification of subcategories that drive or detract from profitability.

**4. Segment-Wise Profit Percentage**

- A pie chart or donut chart represents the percentage of profit contributed by each customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- Users can see how much each segment contributes to the overall profit.

**5. Percentage Contribution of Each Region in Overall Profit**

- A stacked bar chart or pie chart shows the percentage contribution of each region (East, West, Central, South) to the overall profit.
- This view helps assess which regions perform the best in terms of profitability.

**6. State-Wise Profit Earned (Map)**

- A filled map (also called a choropleth map) displays the profit earned in each state across the U.S.
- States are color-coded based on profit levels, allowing users to quickly identify profitable or underperforming regions.

## Interactivity

- The entire dashboard is interactive based on the Category dimension.
- When a user selects a specific category (e.g., Furniture), all other visualizations on the dashboard will automatically update to display profit data related to that category.
- This interaction allows for deeper insights and more focused analysis of the selected category.
